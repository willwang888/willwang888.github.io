								<p>Hi there! As you may know by now, my name is William Wang. Whether you may have stumbled upon my website or you're interested in what I do, I'm glad you're here!</p>
								<p>I was born in Ontario, Canada, but I've lived in San Jose, California for most of my life. I always tell my friends that I wish there was lots of snow around me, but then I think about
								 		having mounds of it everywhere and realize that after a month or so of <a href="http://gph.is/1KxcPHc">this</a>, it'll probably deteriorate into <a href="http://gph.is/1ltIBza">this</a>...</p>
								<p>I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Southern Californa in Los Angeles, and I graduate in 2019. Ironically, before my summer of senior year in high school, I wasn't
									 interested in computer science at all — I really wanted to become a doctor. So, I co-founded a non-profit organization that makes 3D printed prosthetics. Now, although I am fully engaged in
									 programming, my passion for the healthcare industry still exists, and fuels my interest in using the skills I have to help people improve their lives.</p>
								<p>No matter who you are, I want to help you create a better world for the future.</p>
								<p>Feel free to poke around and check out what I do. Take a look at my work <a href="#work">here</a>!</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Over the years, I have been involved in a lot of organizations and activities on campus, including but not limited to (and in no particular order): </p>

								<ul>
								  <li>Co-founding the first <a href="http://fellows.tech.la/">Technology Fellowship Program</a> in Los Angeles that brings together 8 undergraduate students, 6 startups, and 3 venture capital firms in Los Angeles.</li>
								  <li>Developing a <a href="https://github.com/willwang888/Weekndr">product</a> in Lavalab, USC's student run product incubator, and pitching to an audience of 300 and 4 judges.</li>
								  <li>Performing <a href="http://sail.usc.edu/mica/">signal processing and audio learning research</a> in the Media Informatics and Content Analysis (MICA) Lab at USC.</li>
									<li>Working with a team of 6 on a <a href="https://docketcalendar.com/">funded startup.</a></li>
									<li>Organizing a <a href="http://hacksc.com/">hackathon.</a></li>
								</ul>

								<p>My interests lie in entrepreneurship, software development, and deep learning, and I hope to build on those
								concepts as much as I can to make the world a better place.</p>
								<p>I've created a little timeline that visualizes the work experience I have gained and projects that I have done. Check it out below!</p>
